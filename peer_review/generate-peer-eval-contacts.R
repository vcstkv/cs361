# - canvas_user_id,
# - user_id,
# - login_id,
# - sections,
# - group_name,
# - canvas_group_id,
# - group_id
# And creates a Qualtrics contact list with the following fields:
# - Email,
# - First Name,
# - Last Name,
# - Team Name,
# - Team Member i, with i = 1, 2, ..., n (n being the largest team size)
