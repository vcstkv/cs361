### Question 2
# X goes from 1 to 4, 1 is self, 2-4 are team members

# Does the member do an appropriate quantity of work?
# labels[,Q2_X_1]

# How about the quality of the member’s work?
# labels[,Q2_X_2]

# Rate the member’s attitude as a team player (eager to do assigned work, communicated with others, kept appointments, etc.).
# labels[,Q2_X_3]

# Rate the overall value of the member’s technical contribution.
# labels[,Q2_X_4]

# Would you want to work with this person on a project again?
# labels[,Q2_X_5]

### Question 3
# Take 100 points, and divide them among the N team members, including yourself. Give points based on your opinion of what proportion of the credit each member deserves. You may consider quality and quantity of contributions, team-player attitude, and/or any aspects that you feel are relevant. You must give yourself at least 100/N points, whether you honestly feel you deserve them or not. (This is to avoid an unrealistic “self-incrimination” requirement.)
